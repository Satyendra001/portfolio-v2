            Hello! My name is Satyendra and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet.
            My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided to try editing
            custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught
            me a lot about HTML & CSS!
          </p>
          <p className="text-[#8892b0] mb-4">
            Beyond web development, I have a deep passion for robotics. During my college years,
            I was proud to be part of a National level winning ROBOCON team, where we pushed the
            boundaries of innovation and engineering excellence.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[#8892b0] mb-4">
            As a cybersecurity enthusiast, I regularly participate in Capture The Flag (CTF)
            competitions and stay up-to-date with the latest vulnerability threats. This helps me
            build more secure and robust applications.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[#8892b0]">
            When I'm not coding or hacking, you'll find me on the cricket field, immersed in the
            latest anime series, exploring nature through hikes, or spending quality time with my
            family. I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance that fuels my creativity
            and problem-solving abilities.
